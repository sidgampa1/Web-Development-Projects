Pomodoro clock

Pomodoro clocks are used for task management.

They are split into Sessions and Breaks. Sessions are the period of times where
you focus on a task. This is followed by a Break period to relax. Then, you rinse
and repeat!

This web app allows you set a duration for Session and Break and pause and display
as you need.

To Use:
Use the arrow keys to change the duration of the session or break. Press play to
start the timer. Press pause to pause the timer, and press refresh to set the
durations back to the original amount of time.
